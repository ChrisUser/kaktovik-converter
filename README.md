# Kaktovik numbers converter

A simple kaktovik numeric converter both to and from arabic numbers.

Inspired by [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaktovik_numerals) and a recent addition into the Unicode catalog.

## F.A.Q.

- **Why a kaktovik converter?**
- Just to have fun. You can also use it for cryptographic messages ðŸ¤«

<br/>

- **Why not use Unicode for kaktovik characters?**
- The most comprehensive Unicode coverage font ([Roman Czyborra's GNU Unicode Font](http://czyborra.com/unifont/)) has not provided any glyph for these characters yet [^1]. Also the Unicode Consortium has [special terms of use](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D2C0.pdf) for its characters and fonts.
